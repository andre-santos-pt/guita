# GUITA toolkit

This toolkit is a prototype that instruments SWT applications so that the lines of code that create 
and manipulate UI widgets can be traced from the running application. One may click widgets with a
special keystroke and instantly navigate to the corresponding lines in code editor of Eclipse.
